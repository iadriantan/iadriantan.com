# Images Folder

Put all your images here!

## How to Add Images

1. **Upload your image** to this `images/` folder
2. **In your blog post**, reference it like this:

```html
<img src="../images/your-image.jpg" alt="Description of image">
```

## Recommended Image Specs

- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Max width**: 1200px (for faster loading)
- **File size**: Under 500KB if possible
- **Naming**: Use lowercase, hyphens (e.g., `ai-agents-banking.jpg`)

## For Your Profile Photo

Your profile photo placeholder is in `index.html`. To add your real photo:

1. Put your photo in this folder (e.g., `adrian-tan.jpg`)
2. Open `index.html`
3. Find this line (around line 278):
   ```html
   AT
   ```
4. Replace with:
   ```html
   <img src="images/adrian-tan.jpg" alt="Adrian Tan">
   ```

## Image Best Practices

- Use descriptive filenames
- Compress images before uploading (use TinyPNG or similar)
- Add alt text for accessibility
- Keep images relevant to your content

**That's it!** Just drop images here and reference them in your posts.
