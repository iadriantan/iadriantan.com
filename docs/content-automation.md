## 🎯 Maintaining Your Voice

### Do's:
✅ Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences)
✅ Start with the conclusion
✅ Use "Here's what matters" framing
✅ Concrete examples over theory
✅ One clear takeaway

### Don'ts:
❌ Corporate buzzwords ("synergy", "paradigm shift")
❌ Passive voice
❌ Burying the lede
❌ Long-winded explanations
❌ Generic observations

### Voice Examples:

**Generic AI blog:**
> "The landscape of artificial intelligence is rapidly evolving, and organizations must adapt to stay competitive in this dynamic environment."

**Your voice:**
> "AI agents are eating legacy banking infrastructure. Either you build the integration layer, or someone else will."

---

## 🔄 Iteration Process

If Claude's first draft doesn't match your voice:

1. **Too corporate?**
   > "Make this more direct. Cut the business jargon."

2. **Too long?**
   > "Cut this to 400 words. Every sentence needs to earn its place."

3. **Missing your angle?**
   > "This is too generic. Add this perspective: [your take]"

4. **Wrong tone?**
   > "Rewrite this like I'm explaining it to a founder over coffee."
